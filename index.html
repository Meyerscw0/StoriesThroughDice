        <h1>D&D Service-Learning Project: Data, Interpretation, and Identity Correlations</h1>

        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project surveyed 15 individuals about their Dungeons & Dragons characters, motivations, and personal connections to the characters they created. The goal was to understand who participated, what they created, and why they approached character creation the way they did.</p>
            <p>A central success emerged quickly: Over half the participants were new to D&D, with 53% playing for less than a year and one-third being first-time players. This reflects a meaningful project outcome—these sessions created a welcoming space for beginners, many of whom were exploring D&D for the first time.</p>

        <section id="demographics">
            <h2>1. Who Our Players Are (Demographics)</h2>
            <p>Understanding the makeup of the group helps contextualize the creative patterns that appear later. The players were young, diverse, and largely inexperienced, which created a collaborative environment where everyone was discovering the game together.</p>

            <h3>Experience Level</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="experienceChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h3>Age Range</h3>

            <h3>Gender Identity</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="genderChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p>The gender diversity of this group—combined with the large number of beginners—sets the stage for emotionally rich and personally meaningful characters.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="choices">
            <h2>2. What They’re Playing (Character Choices)</h2>
            <p>Participants selected a wide range of character races and classes. New players especially gravitated toward familiar fantasy archetypes such as elves and half-elves, while more experienced players tended to experiment more broadly.</p>
            
            <h3>Character Race</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="raceChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h3>Character Class</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="classChart"></canvas>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="motivations">
            <h2>3. Why They’re Playing (Motivations)</h2>
            <p>Participants selected their motivations for character creation, and their responses were deeply personal.</p>
            
            <h3>Character Motivations</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="motivationChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <p>These results suggest that D&D serves as a flexible space for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>storytelling,</li>
                <li>character expression,</li>
                <li>processing emotions,</li>
                <li>exploring identity,</li>
                <li>and finding empowerment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="correlations">
            <h2>4. Identity-Based Correlations (Respectful Analysis)</h2>
            <p>Beyond the basic data, several meaningful correlations emerged when comparing character choices with gender identity, LGBTQ+ identity, and experience level. These are not generalizations about any population—they reflect patterns specific to this dataset and offer insight into how these particular players approach storytelling.</p>

            <h3>LGBTQ+ Players</h3>
            <p>LGBTQ+ respondents (a majority of the group) consistently gravitated toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>half-elves, tieflings, genasi, and warforged</li>
                <li>bards, druids, clerics, rangers, and paladins</li>
                <li>themes of representation, redemption, identity exploration, and emotional healing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These races often embody liminality or being “between worlds,” which resonated strongly with queer respondents who described their characters as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>exploring family acceptance,</li>
                <li>navigating mixed identities,</li>
                <li>reflecting emotional resilience,</li>
                <li>or representing parts of themselves they are still discovering.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This group also showed higher self-reflection scores, often rating their characters as deeply connected to their real selves.</p>

            <h3>Women & Transfeminine Players</h3>
            <p>Women in the study tended toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>elves, half-elves, and druids/bards/rangers</li>
                <li>caretaker roles</li>
                <li>family-connected backstories</li>
                <li>characters driven by emotional depth or creativity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Their characters frequently explored themes like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>nurturing others,</li>
                <li>artistic struggle,</li>
                <li>grief and healing,</li>
                <li>or reclaiming identity after hardship.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Men (cis and transmasc respondents)</h3>
            <p>Men in the group—both LGBTQ+ and not—often created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>fighters, paladins, barbarians</li>
                <li>tieflings, goblins, elves</li>
                <li>characters wrestling with guilt, duty, or redemption</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A notable pattern: Their character arcs often centered on emotional restraint gradually giving way to healing.</p>

            <h3>Nonbinary & Genderfluid Players</h3>
            <p>These players tended toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>unconventional races (warforged, dwarf, genasi)</li>
                <li>classes associated with creativity or spirituality</li>
                <li>motivation: exploring identity, expression, or self-understanding</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Their stories often expressed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>finding or defining one’s voice,</li>
                <li>navigating vulnerability,</li>
                <li>processing emotions,</li>
                <li>or searching for belonging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experience Level</h3>
            <p>A compelling correlation emerged: <strong>Beginners had the highest emotional depth.</strong></p>
            <p>Players with less than a year of experience had the highest self-reflection score (average 5.0) and the longest or most detailed emotional backstories.</p>
            <p>Experienced players tended to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create more humorous, chaotic, or “vibes-driven” characters</li>
                <li>explore mechanics, class quirks, or roleplay tropes</li>
                <li>put less of their real self directly into the character</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both groups showed creativity—just in different directions.</p>

        <section id="self-reflection">
            <h2>5. Self-Reflection & What Surprised Players</h2>
            <p>Participants rated how much their character reflected their real self.</p>

            <h3>Self-Reflection Scores</h3>

                <canvas id="reflectionScoreChart"></canvas>

            <h3>Average Reflection by Experience</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="avgReflectionChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h4>Interpretation</h4>
            <p>This dataset suggests that newer players use character creation as an immediate form of self-expression, while experienced players use it to experiment with archetypes, humor, or familiar tropes.</p>
            <p>LGBTQ+ respondents in particular were more likely to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>embed aspects of their real lives</li>
                <li>explore identity themes</li>
                <li>process emotional experiences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This aligns with academic findings on TTRPGs as tools for identity exploration.</p>

                <li>The project successfully engaged new players.</li>
                <li>Character creation served different emotional roles depending on identity and experience.</li>
