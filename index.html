        <h1>D&D Service-Learning Project: Data, Interpretation, and Identity Correlations</h1>

        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project surveyed 15 individuals about their Dungeons & Dragons characters, motivations, and personal connections to the characters they created. The goal was to understand who participated, what they created, and why they approached character creation the way they did.</p>
            [cite_start]<p>A central success emerged quickly: Over half the participants were new to D&D, with 53% playing for less than a year and one-third being first-time players[cite: 1].</p>
        </section>

        <section id="demographics">
            <h2>1. Who Our Players Are (Demographics)</h2>
            <p>Understanding the makeup of the group helps contextualize the creative patterns that appear later. The players were young, diverse, and largely inexperienced.</p>

            <h3>Experience Level</h3>
            <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="experienceChart"></canvas></div>

            <h3>Age Range</h3>
            <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="ageChart"></canvas></div>

            <h3>Gender Identity</h3>
            <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="genderChart"></canvas></div>
            <p>The gender diversity of this group—combined with the large number of beginners—sets the stage for emotionally rich and personally meaningful characters.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="choices">
            <h2>2. What They’re Playing (Character Choices)</h2>
            <p>Participants selected a wide range of character races and classes. [cite_start]New players especially gravitated toward familiar fantasy archetypes such as elves and half-elves[cite: 1].</p>
            
            <h3>Character Race</h3>
            <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="raceChart"></canvas></div>

            <h3>Character Class</h3>
            <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="classChart"></canvas></div>
        </section>

        <section id="motivations">
            <h2>3. Why They’re Playing (Motivations)</h2>
            <p>Participants selected their motivations for character creation, and their responses were deeply personal.</p>
            <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="motivationChart"></canvas></div>
            <p>These results suggest that D&D serves as a flexible space for storytelling, character expression, processing emotions, and exploring identity.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="correlations">
            <h2>4. Identity-Based Correlations</h2>
            <p>Beyond the basic data, several meaningful correlations emerged when comparing character choices with gender identity and experience level.</p>
            
            <h3>LGBTQ+ Players</h3>
            <p>Gravitated toward half-elves, tieflings, and themes of representation or "being between worlds." This group often rated their characters as deeply connected to their real selves.</p>

            <h3>Experience Level</h3>
            [cite_start]<p><strong>Beginners had the highest emotional depth.</strong> Players with less than a year of experience had the highest self-reflection score (average 5.0)[cite: 1].</p>
        </section>

        <section id="self-reflection">
            <h2>5. Self-Reflection & What Surprised Players</h2>
            <p>Participants rated how much their character reflected their real self.</p>
            <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="reflectionScoreChart"></canvas></div>
            
            <h3>Average Reflection by Experience</h3>
            <div class="chart-container"><canvas id="avgReflectionChart"></canvas></div>
        </section>
        
        <section id="analysis-conclusion">
            <h2>6. Analysis Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The data reveals that character creation served different emotional roles depending on identity and experience. Beginners displayed the strongest personal connection to their characters, while experienced players experimented more with mechanics.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="project-reflections">
            <h2>7. Project Process & Reflections</h2>
            <p>The 15 player surveys were gathered from a group of players that I personally led through a guided character creation exercise. This hands-on approach was challenging but rewarding.</p>
            <h3>What Went Well</h3>
            <p>The collaborative aspect was a major success. Players highlighted the fun of designing aesthetics and workshopping ideas together.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Scheduling was difficult, as was ensuring clarity when explaining mechanics to complete newcomers.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="final-conclusion">
            <h2>8. Final Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I learned a great deal about these players and their stories. Overall, this dataset shows D&D as a powerful environment for creativity and identity expression—especially for newer players discovering these tools for the first time.</p>
