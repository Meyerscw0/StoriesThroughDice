        <h1>Stories Through Dice Data, Interpretation, and Identity Correlations</h1>

        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project surveyed 15 individuals about their Dungeons & Dragons characters, motivations, and personal connections to the characters they created. The goal was to understand who participated, what they created, and why they approached character creation the way they did.</p>
            <p>A central success emerged quickly: Over half the participants were new to D&D, with 53% playing for less than a year and one-third being first-time players. This reflects a meaningful project outcome these sessions created a welcoming space for beginners, many of whom were exploring D&D for the first time.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="demographics">
            <h2>1. Who Our Players Are (Demographics)</h2>
            <p>Understanding the makeup of the group helps contextualize the creative patterns that appear later. The players were young, diverse, and largely inexperienced, which created a collaborative environment where everyone was discovering the game together. I also want to take a momnet that any correlations found here are not generalizations. I wanted to showcase the connections I saw in this group only and are in no way reflecting my own beliefs or ideals of gender norms or stereotypes </p>

            <h3>Experience Level</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="experienceChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h3>Age Range</h3>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="genderChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p>The gender diversity of this group—combined with the large number of beginners—sets the stage for emotionally rich and personally meaningful characters.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="choices">
            <h2>2. What They’re Playing (Character Choices)</h2>
            <p>Participants selected a wide range of character races and classes. New players especially gravitated toward familiar fantasy archetypes such as elves and half-elves, while more experienced players tended to experiment more broadly.</p>
            
            <h3>Character Race</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="raceChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h3>Character Class</h3>

                <canvas id="classChart"></canvas>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="motivations">
            <h2>3. Why They’re Playing (Motivations)</h2>
            <p>Participants selected their motivations for character creation, and their responses were deeply personal.</p>
            
            <h3>Character Motivations</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="motivationChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <p>These results suggest that D&D serves as a flexible space for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>storytelling,</li>
                <li>character expression,</li>
                <li>processing emotions,</li>
                <li>exploring identity,</li>
                <li>and finding empowerment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="correlations">
            <h2>4. Identity-Based Correlations (Respectful Analysis)</h2>
            <p>Beyond the basic data, several meaningful correlations emerged when comparing character choices with gender identity, LGBTQ+ identity, and experience level. These are not generalizations about any population—they reflect patterns specific to this dataset and offer insight into how these particular players approach storytelling.</p>

            <h3>LGBTQ+ Players</h3>
            <p>LGBTQ+ respondents (a majority of the group) consistently gravitated toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>half-elves, tieflings, genasi, and warforged</li>
                <li>bards, druids, clerics, rangers, and paladins</li>
                <li>themes of representation, redemption, identity exploration, and emotional healing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These races often embody liminality or being “between worlds,” which resonated strongly with queer respondents who described their characters as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>exploring family acceptance,</li>
                <li>navigating mixed identities,</li>
                <li>reflecting emotional resilience,</li>
                <li>or representing parts of themselves they are still discovering.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This group also showed higher self-reflection scores, often rating their characters as deeply connected to their real selves.</p>

            <h3>Women & Transfeminine Players</h3>
            <p>Women in the study tended toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>elves, half-elves, and druids/bards/rangers</li>
                <li>family-connected backstories</li>
                <li>characters driven by emotional depth or creativity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Their characters frequently explored themes like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>nurturing others,</li>
                <li>artistic struggle,</li>
                <li>grief and healing,</li>
                <li>or reclaiming identity after hardship.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Men (cis and transmasc respondents)</h3>
            <p>Men in the group—both LGBTQ+ and not—often created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>fighters, paladins, barbarians</li>
                <li>tieflings, goblins, elves</li>
                <li>characters wrestling with guilt, duty, or redemption</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A notable pattern: Their character arcs often centered on emotional restraint gradually giving way to healing.</p>

            <h3>Nonbinary & Genderfluid Players</h3>
            <p>These players tended toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>unconventional races (warforged, dwarf, genasi)</li>
                <li>classes associated with creativity or spirituality</li>
                <li>motivation: exploring identity, expression, or self-understanding</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Their stories often expressed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>finding or defining one’s voice,</li>
                <li>navigating vulnerability,</li>
                <li>processing emotions,</li>
                <li>or searching for belonging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Experience Level</h3>
            <p>A compelling correlation emerged: <strong>Beginners had the highest emotional depth.</strong></p>
            <p>Players with less than a year of experience had the highest self-reflection score (average 5.0) and the longest or most detailed emotional backstories.</p>
            <p>Experienced players tended to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create more humorous, chaotic, or “vibes-driven” characters</li>
                <li>explore mechanics, class quirks, or roleplay tropes</li>
                <li>put less of their real self directly into the character</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both groups showed creativity—just in different directions.</p>

            <h2>5. Self-Reflection & What Surprised Players</h2>
            <p>Participants rated how much their character reflected their real self.</p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="avgReflectionChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h4>Interpretation</h4>
            <p>This dataset suggests that newer players use character creation as an immediate form of self-expression, while experienced players use it to experiment with archetypes, humor, or familiar tropes.</p>
            <p>LGBTQ+ respondents in particular were more likely to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>embed aspects of their real lives</li>
                <li>explore identity themes</li>
                <li>process emotional experiences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This aligns with academic findings on TTRPGs as tools for identity exploration.</p>

        <section id="analysis-conclusion">
            <h2>6. Analysis Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project provided a window into how young and diverse players use D&D as a storytelling space. The data reveals that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The project successfully engaged new players.</li>
                <li>Character creation served different emotional roles depending on identity and experience.</li>
                <li>LGBTQ+ players often approached characters as extensions of identity exploration.</li>
                <li>Women and nonbinary players leaned toward expressive, emotionally rich narratives.</li>
                <li>Men often explored redemption, honor, and vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Beginners displayed the strongest personal connection to their characters.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="project-reflections">
            <h2>7. Project Process & Reflections</h2>
            <p>This section details the implementation of the service-learning project, its challenges, and the personal learnings derived from the experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>The 15 player surveys were gathered from a group of players that I personally led through a guided character creation exercise. This hands-on approach was challenging but also incredibly rewarding, as it provided an opportunity to work closely with new players and introduce them to the game. Having the chance to work and talk with everyone directly was a fantastic experience.</p>
            
            <h3>What Went Well</h3>
            <p>The collaborative aspect was a major success. Players mentioned how much they enjoyed creating unique and interesting characters. They specifically highlighted the fun of designing their character's aesthetics, developing their backstory, and workshopping those ideas with the other players. This created a positive, shared storytelling environment right from the start.</p>
            
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Two main challenges emerged:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Coordinating a group of 15 people for a guided session was logistically difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarity for New Players:</strong> It was challenging to ensure I was explaining everything clearly. When players have very little experience with the medium of D&D as a whole, it's difficult to gauge if they are absorbing all the information or feeling overwhelmed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Surprised Me</h3>
            <p>The data itself held several surprises:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The **total lack of Human characters** among respondents was notable, given it's a common choice in many fantasy settings.</li>
                <li>The sheer **range of motivations** for playing, from "aesthetics" to "escaping stress" to "identity exploration."</li>
                <li>It was also interesting to see **how many people gravitated toward fighting/battle-focused classes** like Barbarian and Fighter, even in a group focused on narrative.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="final-conclusion">
            <h2>8. Final Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I learned a great deal about these players and their characters' stories through this project. More broadly, I gained insight into the vast range of reasons why so many different people might be interested in playing D&D. It is a powerful tool for creativity, expression, and connection.</p>
            <p>Overall, this dataset shows D&D as a powerful environment for creativity, identity expression, emotional exploration, and collaborative storytelling—especially for newer players discovering these tools for the first time. Leading this project was a deeply rewarding experience.</p>
