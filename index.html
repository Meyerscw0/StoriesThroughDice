        <h1>D&D Service-Learning Project: Data, Interpretation, and Identity Correlations</h1>

        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project surveyed 15 individuals about their Dungeons & Dragons characters, motivations, and personal connections to the characters they created. The goal was to understand who participated, what they created, and why they approached character creation the way they did.</p>
            <p>A central success emerged quickly: Over half the participants were new to D&D, with 53% playing for less than a year and one-third being first-time players. This reflects a meaningful project outcome—these sessions created a welcoming space for beginners, many of whom were exploring D&D for the first time.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="demographics">
            <h2>1. Who Our Players Are (Demographics)</h2>
            <p>Understanding the makeup of the group helps contextualize the creative patterns that appear later. The players were young, diverse, and largely inexperienced, which created a collaborative environment where everyone was discovering the game together.</p>

            <h3>Experience Level</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="experienceChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h3>Age Range</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="ageChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h3>Gender Identity</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="genderChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p>The gender diversity of this group—combined with the large number of beginners—sets the stage for emotionally rich and personally meaningful characters.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="choices">
            <h2>2. What They’re Playing (Character Choices)</h2>
            <p>Participants selected a wide range of character races and classes. New players especially gravitated toward familiar fantasy archetypes such as elves and half-elves, while more experienced players tended to experiment more broadly.</p>
            
            <h3>Character Race</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="raceChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h3>Character Class</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="classChart"></canvas>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="motivations">
            <h2>3. Why They’re Playing (Motivations)</h2>
            <p>Participants selected their motivations for character creation, and their responses were deeply personal.</p>
            
            <h3>Character Motivations</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="motivationChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <p>These results suggest that D&D serves as a flexible space for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>storytelling,</li>
                <li>character expression,</li>
                <li>processing emotions,</li>
                <li>exploring identity,</li>
                <li>and finding empowerment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="correlations">
            <h2>4. Identity-Based Correlations (Respectful Analysis)</h2>
            <p>Beyond the basic data, several meaningful correlations emerged when comparing character choices with gender identity, LGBTQ+ identity, and experience level. These are not generalizations about any population—they reflect patterns specific to this dataset and offer insight into how these particular players approach storytelling.</p>

            <h3>LGBTQ+ Players</h3>
            <p>LGBTQ+ respondents (a majority of the group) consistently gravitated toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>half-elves, tieflings, genasi, and warforged</li>
                <li>bards, druids, clerics, rangers, and paladins</li>
                <li>themes of representation, redemption, identity exploration, and emotional healing</li>
            </ul>
            
            </section>

        <section id="self-reflection">
            <h2>5. Self-Reflection & What Surprised Players</h2>
            <p>Participants rated how much their character reflected their real self.</p>

            <h3>Self-Reflection Scores</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="reflectionScoreChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h3>Average Reflection by Experience</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="avgReflectionChart"></canvas>
            </div>

            <h4>Interpretation</h4>
            <p>This dataset suggests that newer players use character creation as an immediate form of self-expression, while experienced players use it to experiment with archetypes, humor, or familiar tropes.</p>
            
            </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project provided a window into how young and diverse players use D&D as a storytelling space. The data reveals that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The project successfully engaged new players.</li>
                <li>Character creation served different emotional roles depending on identity and experience.</li>
                <li>Beginners displayed the strongest personal connection to their characters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, this dataset shows D&D as a powerful environment for creativity, identity expression, emotional exploration, and collaborative storytelling—especially for newer players discovering these tools for the first time.</p>
